## Usage

Upload images to the images/**albumname**/ directories and open www.yoursite.com/path/here/?generate to
automatically generate thumbnails for all new images.

* __photoswipe__  (photoswipe resources)
* __thumbs__      (thumbnails are automatically generated here)

Album directory names should be of the format XXName where XX is the ordering, e.g. 01Test Album.
